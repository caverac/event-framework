# Glossary

## Prehension
A selective "grasp" of what matters: the taking-up of relevant facts, inputs, and relations from the past into the present decision.

## Invariant 
A stable form or constraint (Whiteheadâ€™s "eternal object") that ingresses into a decision, shaping what counts as valid or permissible.

## Occasion
A concrete unit of process: one bounded decision event that gathers prehensions, applies invariants, and produces an outcome.

## Concrescence
The internal resolving of many influences into one result: how an occasion integrates its prehensions under invariants to determine a single outcome.

## Satisfaction
The completed state of an occasion: the committed result (e.g., new aggregate state and derived facts) once concrescence is done.

## Superject
What the occasion puts into the world for others: the externally available outcome (e.g., emitted domain event) that can be prehended by subsequent occasions.
